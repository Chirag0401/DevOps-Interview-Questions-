# Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps

In Kubernetes, **Secrets** and **ConfigMaps** are used to manage configuration data for applications. They are similar but serve different purposes, especially regarding sensitive data.

---

## **ConfigMap**

### Purpose
- Store **non-sensitive** configuration data as key-value pairs.

### Use Cases
- Application settings
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Command-line arguments

### Features
- Data is stored in **plain text** in etcd.
- Used to decouple configuration from application code.
- Can store up to **1MB** of data.

### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "mysql://user@localhost:3306/mydb"
  APP_MODE: "production"

Usage in a Pod

As Environment Variables

envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: app-config

As a Mounted File

volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/config
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: app-config

Secrets

Purpose

	•	Store sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or certificates.

Use Cases

	•	Database credentials
	•	TLS certificates
	•	Sensitive application configurations

Features

	•	Data is Base64 encoded by default (not encrypted).
	•	Can be encrypted at rest in etcd (enable encryption for security).
	•	Access can be controlled using RBAC.
	•	Similar usage patterns as ConfigMaps but designed for sensitive data.

Example YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # Base64 encoded value of "password"

Usage in a Pod

As Environment Variables

env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: app-secret
        key: DB_PASSWORD

As a Mounted File

volumeMounts:
  - name: secret-volume
    mountPath: /etc/secret
volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: app-secret

Key Differences

Aspect	ConfigMap	Secret
Purpose	Non-sensitive configuration data	Sensitive data like credentials
Storage	Plain text in etcd	Base64 encoded (optionally encrypted)
Access	General-purpose data	Controlled access with RBAC
Security	No encryption	Supports encryption at rest
Size Limit	1MB	1MB

Best Practices

	1.	Separate Secrets and Configurations: Avoid mixing sensitive and non-sensitive data for better security management.
	2.	Use Encryption: Enable etcd encryption for Secrets to ensure sensitive data is secure.
	3.	Access Control: Use RBAC to control who can access Secrets and ConfigMaps.
	4.	Avoid Hardcoding: Do not hardcode sensitive or configuration data directly in your application code.
	5.	Regular Updates: Rotate Secrets regularly to minimize the risk of exposure.
