The uploaded image contains 34 questions. I’ll provide comprehensive answers to each of them in sequence:

1. What scripting languages are you familiar with?

	•	Bash, Python, PowerShell, JavaScript (Node.js), and Groovy (for Jenkins pipelines).

2. What are artifacts in GitLab CI?

	•	Artifacts are files generated by jobs in GitLab CI/CD that are passed between stages or downloaded after the pipeline completes. Examples include compiled binaries, test results, or log files.

3. What is a private module registry in Terraform?

	•	A private module registry allows you to store and share Terraform modules securely within an organization. It enables better collaboration by providing access controls, versioning, and a centralized repository.

4. If you delete the local Terraform state file and it’s not stored in S3 or DynamoDB, how can you recover it?

	•	You cannot directly recover a deleted local state file unless you have backups. To mitigate this risk, always enable remote state storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB for locking).

5. How do you import resources into Terraform?

	•	Use the terraform import command:

terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>

Then, update the Terraform configuration to match the imported resource’s state.

6. What is a dynamic block in Terraform?

	•	A dynamic block allows you to programmatically generate multiple nested blocks within a resource or module, using a loop structure.

7. How can you create EC2 instances in two different AWS accounts simultaneously using Terraform?

	•	Use two provider blocks with different credentials and specify the alias attribute to distinguish the accounts. Then configure resources under each provider.

8. How do you handle an error stating that the resource already exists when creating resources with Terraform?

	•	Import the existing resource into Terraform using terraform import and reconcile the configuration with the current state.

9. How does Terraform refresh work?

	•	The terraform refresh command updates the Terraform state file to reflect the actual state of resources in the cloud, without modifying infrastructure.

10. How would you upgrade Terraform plugins?

	•	Run:

terraform init -upgrade

This upgrades provider plugins to the latest version allowed by the configuration.

11. What are the different types of Kubernetes volumes?

	•	Persistent Volume (PV)
	•	Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
	•	ConfigMap
	•	Secret
	•	HostPath
	•	EmptyDir
	•	NFS
	•	AWS EBS, GCE Persistent Disk, Azure Disk, etc.

12. If a pod is in a crash loop, what might be the reasons, and how can you recover it?

	•	Reasons:
	•	Application errors
	•	Misconfigured environment variables
	•	Insufficient resources
	•	Recovery:
	•	Check logs using kubectl logs.
	•	Debug the pod using kubectl describe.
	•	Fix the issue and redeploy.

13. What is the difference between StatefulSet and DaemonSet?

	•	StatefulSet: Manages stateful applications requiring persistent identity and storage (e.g., databases).
	•	DaemonSet: Ensures a copy of the pod runs on every node (e.g., monitoring or logging agents).

14. What is a sidecar container in Kubernetes, and what are its use cases?

	•	A sidecar container enhances the functionality of the main application container. Common use cases include log aggregation, proxying, and monitoring.

15. If pods fail to start during a rolling update, what strategy would you use to identify the issue and rollback?

	•	Use kubectl rollout history to inspect changes.
	•	Debug failing pods with kubectl logs and kubectl describe.
	•	Rollback with kubectl rollout undo.

16. How can we enable communication between 500 AWS accounts internally?

	•	Use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share resources.
	•	Set up a central VPC with Transit Gateway and establish peering connections.

17. How to configure a solution where a Lambda function triggers on an S3 upload and updates DynamoDB?

	•	Configure an S3 event notification to trigger the Lambda.
	•	Use the AWS SDK within the Lambda function to process the upload and update DynamoDB.

18. What is the standard port for RDP?

	•	Port 3389.

19. How do you configure a Windows EC2 instance to join an Active Directory domain?

	•	Install the Active Directory tools.
	•	Update the instance’s DNS to point to the domain controller.
	•	Use the Add-Computer PowerShell command or GUI to join the domain.

20. How can you copy files from a Linux server to an S3 bucket?

	•	Use the AWS CLI:

aws s3 cp /path/to/file s3://bucket-name/

21. What permissions do you need to grant for that S3 bucket?

	•	s3:PutObject for uploading files.
	•	s3:GetObject for reading files.

22. What are the different types of VPC endpoints and when do you use them?

	•	Interface Endpoints: Connect to AWS services over private IPs.
	•	Gateway Endpoints: Connect to S3 or DynamoDB via private routes.

23. How to resolve an image pullback error when using an Alpine image pushed to ECR in a pipeline?

	•	Ensure the ECR repository has the correct permissions.
	•	Verify Docker credentials are correctly configured.

24. What is the maximum size of an S3 object?

	•	5 TB.

25. What encryption options do we have in S3?

	•	Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C).
	•	Client-Side Encryption.

26. Can you explain IAM user, IAM role, and IAM group in AWS?

	•	IAM User: Represents a person or service.
	•	IAM Role: Assumes permissions temporarily.
	•	IAM Group: Groups users to share permissions.

27. What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM policy document?

	•	An IAM role grants temporary access, while a policy document defines the permissions.

28. What are inline policies and managed policies?

	•	Inline Policies: Directly attached to a user, group, or role.
	•	Managed Policies: Standalone and reusable across multiple entities.

29. How can we add a load balancer to Route 53?

	•	Create an alias record in Route 53 pointing to the load balancer’s DNS name.

30. What are A records and CNAME records?

	•	A Record: Maps a domain to an IP.
	•	CNAME Record: Maps a domain to another domain.

31. What is the use of a target group in a load balancer?

	•	To define backend servers that the load balancer routes traffic to.

32. If a target group is unhealthy, what might be the reasons?

	•	Failing health checks due to:
	•	Application errors
	•	Network misconfigurations

33. Can you share your screen and write a Jenkins pipeline?

	•	Yes, I can demonstrate by creating a simple Jenkinsfile:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}

Let me know if you need further explanations on any of the answers!
